# TrackBugiOSApp

An iOS application where people have to kill the bug for the programming beginner. A code snippet that throws a certain error. The users have to track the bug to continue to the next level.

This project is worked on by Wenbo Liu.

I've also made a demo video to explain in an overview what the application is about.
